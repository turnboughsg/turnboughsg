- 👋 Hi, I’m @turnboughsg
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack data engineering, developing software for data platforms & cloud solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently revisiting Designing Data-Intensive Applications and Fundamentals of Data Engineering.
- 👩🏽‍💻 I'm studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Exam, Power BI Data Analyst Exam, Azure Data Engineering Associate Exam, and completing the Learning Data Engineering Academy with Andreas Kretz.
- 🦄 I also have a goal to work through all the Data Camp tracks in Python, Tableau, and Power BI for practice. I promise I have come to terms with not being able to know everything... but the time is going to pass anyways, so I'll be practicing 😊 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analytics projects and developing cloud solutions.
